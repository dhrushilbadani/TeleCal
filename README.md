# TeleCal
Integrates Cal students' class schedules (from TeleBears) with their Google Calendars. In Python.

This is a Python tool to integrate Cal students' class schedules (from [TeleBears](https://telebears.berkeley.edu/telebears/home)) with their [Google Calendars](https://www.google.com/calendar/). No need to login to TeleBears to check your schedule ever again, it's all on your Google Calendar! 

Uses the [Google Calendar API](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/quickstart/python), [Selenium](http://selenium-python.readthedocs.org/), [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) and [BeautifulSoup](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/beautifulsoup4). Since there's no TeleBears API, I had to work my way around CalNet authentication using Selenium and PhantomJS ;)

##Usage
* Download the .zip file from the pane on the right >> , and extract its contents (Git folks can feel free to fork + pull instead).
* [Install pip](http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/stable/installing/), if you haven't already. It's rather useful.
* Install dependencies from within the extracted folder:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
*  Run TeleCal.py (in the extracted folder):
    ```
    python TeleCal.py
    ```
* You'll first be asked to enter your CalNet credentials -- I'm not storing them, I swear. Check the source code if you're worried!
* You'll then be provided with two choices for your Google Calendar:
  * Use existing Google credentials that TeleCal stores securely on your machine (if they exist), or
  * Provide new Google credentials by logging in with OAuth2 authentication to your Google account in a browser window that'll automatically open up after the next step.
* You'll then be asked to provide the end date for the semester.

Voil√†, TeleCal will then integrate your class schedule into your Google Calendar! If you've synced your smartphone's calendar with your Google account, it'll show up there as well.

**I tried creating an executable using pyinstaller. Didn't work unfortunately!
